# Credit Risk Prediction Engine

## Project Overview
Developed a prototype credit risk assessment system that demonstrates the application of machine learning in financial risk analysis. The solution simulates financial data, implements risk features, and serves predictions through a REST API.

## Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies
- **Python**: Implemented data generation, model training, and API endpoints
- **Scikit-learn**: Built logistic regression models for credit risk classification
- **FastAPI**: Created a REST API for risk scoring
- **Pandas/Numpy**: Processed financial data and engineered features
- **Joblib**: Utilized for model serialization

### Key Features
- Implemented a data pipeline that generates and processes financial records with multiple risk indicators
- Engineered domain-specific features including:
  - Loan-to-income ratios
  - Credit utilization metrics
  - Debt service coverage ratios
- Developed a modular architecture separating data processing, modeling, and API layers

### Technical Implementation
- **Data Pipeline**: Built a data generation system with realistic financial distributions
- **Feature Engineering**: Implemented financial ratio calculations and categorical encoding
- **Model Development**: Trained and evaluated logistic regression models for risk classification
- **API Layer**: Created REST endpoints for model inference with input validation

### Learning Outcomes
- Gained hands-on experience with end-to-end machine learning system development
- Developed understanding of credit risk modeling concepts and challenges
- Practiced clean code principles and software design patterns
- Learned to structure machine learning projects for maintainability
